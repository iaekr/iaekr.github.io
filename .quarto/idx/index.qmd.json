Or are you not sure where to start with your next laptop purchase? Want to look into other options aside from expensive Macbooks?\n\nAs students, our digital devices are key to our success in school. According to UNiDAYS, 97% of students say that their laptop is vital to their academic success, and 88% of students do research before buying their laptops (UNiDAYS, 2021). However, a significant 65% of students base their next laptop decision off of their previous experiences (UNiDAYS, 2021). This shows that we may be unaware about the options available out there, especially if we have not tried a variety of laptops before.\n\nBuying a wrong laptop would be a costly decision as well. We are budget-strapped students after all!\n\n![Source: BAM Agency](student%20no%20money.jpg)\n\nThus, welcome to my data story, where I take you through the analysis of a csv file, where we can both gain some insights about laptop brands, specifications, prices, and even its weight! Through this journey, I hope we both gain an awareness of what types of laptops there are, and what categories to begin our search in the next time we find ourselves in need of a laptop.\n\nPersonally, I'm interested in finding what the most common specs are (i.e. the most basic laptop models) -- that would mark a good place for me to start looking into laptops, and I could start looking for affordable options with the same specs, or for any specific or different specs I may need.\n\n![Source: vGeek](laptop%20image.jpg)\n\n## Introducing: Our data\n\nWith the data set named \"**Laptop Prices Based on its specifications \"** by user Abdul Rehman Amer from the website Kaggle (Amer, 2024), we can look at every computer that is manufactured this year.\n\nBelow is the summary of the data set at hand. There are a total of 12 columns, and we can look each laptop's Company (or brand name), TypeName (Category of laptop), Inches (size of laptop), ScreenResolution (Screen Size), CPU, RAM, Memory, GPU, OpSys, Weight, and Price!\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}\nlaptop_data <- read.csv(\"laptop_data.csv\")\nsuppressMessages({\n  suppressWarnings({\n    library(tidyverse)\n    library(fixerapi)\n    library(ggplot2)\n    library(dplyr)\n    library(readr)\n    library(ggtext)\n    library(plotly)\n    library(viridis)\noptions(scipen = 999)\nknitr::kable(head(laptop_data))\n\n  })\n})\n\n```\n\nThis is just a snippet of the entire data set. As individuals who may have different intentions in what they will do with their laptops, e.g. code, graphic design, gaming, writing essays, streaming videos, there is a number of specifications we may look at. However, price is arguably one of the stronger factors in our wallet-friendly decisions.\n\nBefore we delve into the visualisations for each specification, here's a quick box plot of each specification we will investigate, against the prices.\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"600\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://iaekr.shinyapps.io/personal_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\nLet's break it down into simpler visualisations so we understand what it is talking about!\n\n## Number of Laptops by Company\n\nHere are the total number of laptops in the dataset, arranged by the brands that produce them!\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}\ntotal_brands_and_laptops <- laptop_data %>%\n  group_by(Company) %>%\n  tally()\n\n# Define new colors for the companies\nbrand_colors <- c(\n  \"Asus\" = \"#eac435\", \"HP\" = \"#345995\", \"Apple\" = \"#03cea4\", \n  \"Dell\" = \"#fb4d3d\", \"Lenovo\" = \"#ca1551\", \n  \"Toshiba\" = \"#a0d1e3\", \"MSI\" = \"#e1a0d1\", \"Acer\" = \"#d1a0e3\", \n  \"Samsung\" = \"#f0c2ff\", \"Sony\" = \"#f7a6c2\", \"Huawei\" = \"#ffacac\", \n  \"Google\" = \"#ffc6ac\", \"Razer\" = \"#ffd9ac\", \"Microsoft\" = \"#ffe6ac\", \n  \"Xiaomi\" = \"#fff4ac\", \"Fujitsu\" = \"#e5ffac\", \"Mediacom\" = \"#acf2ff\", \n  \"LG\" = \"#acddff\", \"Chuwi\" = \"#acaaff\"\n)\n\n# Use the new colors in your plots\nggplot(total_brands_and_laptops, aes(x = reorder(Company, n), y = n, fill = Company)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend=FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Company\", y = \"Number of Laptop Types\", title = \"Number of Laptop Types by Company\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)\n```\n\nPersonally, I have never heard of brands such as Chuwi, Mediacom or Vero. Have you seen these laptops before?\n\n![Source: Shopee](three%20unknown%20laptops.png)\n\nIt looks like Vero is an environmentally friendly laptop line from Acer! Let's merge the companies into one for clarity's sake, into a category called Acer&V.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}\ntotal_brands_and_laptops2 <- laptop_data %>%\n  mutate(Company = ifelse(Company %in% c(\"Acer\", \"Vero\"), \"Acer&V\", Company)) %>%\n  group_by(Company) %>%\n  tally()\n\n# Define new colors for the companies\nbrand_colors <- c(\n  \"Asus\" = \"#eac435\", \"HP\" = \"#345995\", \"Apple\" = \"#03cea4\", \n  \"Dell\" = \"#fb4d3d\", \"Lenovo\" = \"#ca1551\", \n  \"Toshiba\" = \"#a0d1e3\", \"MSI\" = \"#e1a0d1\", \"Acer&V\" = \"#d1a0e3\", \n  \"Samsung\" = \"#f0c2ff\", \"Sony\" = \"#f7a6c2\", \"Huawei\" = \"#ffacac\", \n  \"Google\" = \"#ffc6ac\", \"Razer\" = \"#ffd9ac\", \"Microsoft\" = \"#ffe6ac\", \n  \"Xiaomi\" = \"#fff4ac\", \"Fujitsu\" = \"#e5ffac\", \"Mediacom\" = \"#acf2ff\", \n  \"LG\" = \"#acddff\", \"Chuwi\" = \"#acaaff\"\n)\n\n# Use the new colors in your plots\nggplot(total_brands_and_laptops2, aes(x = reorder(Company, n), y = n, fill = Company)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend=FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Company\", y = \"Number of Laptop Types\", title = \"Number of Laptop Types by Company\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)\n```\n\nThere are also many, many companies that produced very little laptops, and I doubt that I would want to buy from these brands. Thus, they're not relevant to my analysis. I removed brands who produced less than 20 laptops from the data set.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}\nlaptop_data2 <- laptop_data %>%\n  mutate(Company = ifelse(Company %in% c(\"Acer\", \"Vero\"), \"Acer&V\", Company)) \n\nbrand_nos <- laptop_data2 %>% \n  group_by(Company) %>% \n  tally() %>% \n  filter(n>10) %>% \n  arrange(desc(n))\n\n# Define new colors for the companies\nbrand_colors <- c(\n  \"Asus\" = \"#eac435\", \"HP\" = \"#345995\", \"Apple\" = \"#03cea4\", \n  \"Dell\" = \"#fb4d3d\", \"Lenovo\" = \"#ca1551\", \n  \"Toshiba\" = \"#a0d1e3\", \"MSI\" = \"#e1a0d1\", \"Acer&V\" = \"#d1a0e3\", \n  \"Samsung\" = \"#f0c2ff\", \"Sony\" = \"#f7a6c2\", \"Huawei\" = \"#ffacac\", \n  \"Google\" = \"#ffc6ac\", \"Razer\" = \"#ffd9ac\", \"Microsoft\" = \"#ffe6ac\", \n  \"Xiaomi\" = \"#fff4ac\", \"Fujitsu\" = \"#e5ffac\", \"Mediacom\" = \"#acf2ff\", \n  \"LG\" = \"#acddff\", \"Chuwi\" = \"#acaaff\"\n)\n\n#only 9 brands\nggplot(brand_nos, aes(x = reorder(Company, n), y = n, fill = Company)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x = \"Company\", y = \"Number of Laptops\", title = \"Number of Laptops Produced by Each Company\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)\n```\n\nMuch better!\n\n### Company against Laptop Price\n\nBelow is the plot of the **number of computers** each **company** produces against the **price of each unit of computers**. Here, we can see which company tends to produce more affordable ranges of computers, and which company tends to produce more expensive range of computers.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\nbrand_quantity <- laptop_data %>% \n  select(Company, Weight, Price) %>% \n  group_by(Company) %>% \n  mutate(count = n()) %>% \n  filter(count>10) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  select(-count)\n\ntosgd <- 0.016\ntousd <- 0.012\n\nbrand_quantity <- brand_quantity %>% \n  mutate(Price = Price * tousd)\n\n#ggplot(brand_quantity, aes(x = Price, y = Company)) + geom_boxplot()\nggplot(brand_quantity, aes(x = Price, y = reorder(Company, Price), fill = Company)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Price\", y = \"Company\") +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)\n```\n\nWe observe some outliers in the data. In the above box plot, while the whiskers of each box vary, there are some data points that indiciate one or two abnormally expensive computers that lie beyond even the maximum value of the range of computers.\n\nFor example, Lenovo produces one laptop that costs more than \\$3,000, unusual as their line of laptops usually range from less than \\$500 to less than \\$1,000. ASUS also produces two computers that cost around \\$1,500, despite its range of products largely falling under \\$1,000. We can also see that Apple and MSI are the most consistent in their pricings, as there are no outliers in their box plots. They also happen to have the highest mean prices for their laptops, alongside Toshiba.\n\n## Number of Laptop Types by Category of Laptops\n\nWhile we can look at the data through the lens of the company that produces them, we can also investigate the data through the Category of Laptops.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\ntypename_colour <- c(\n  \"2 in 1 Convertible\" = \"#E3B505\", \"Gaming\" = \"#95190C\", \"Netbook\" = \"#610345\", \"Notebook\" = \"#107E7D\", \"Ultrabook\"=\"#044B7F\", \"Workstation\"=\"#D72638\"\n)\n\nggplot(laptop_data, aes(x = TypeName, fill = TypeName)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Category\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Number of laptops against Category of Laptops\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = typename_colour)\n```\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Notebook category wins by a landslide in terms of quantity produced, with more than 650 types produced. On the other hand, Netbooks and Workstations are lesser produced, and perhaps this means there is a small demand for such laptops!\n\nCuriously, there are only a little more than 100 2 in 1 Convertible laptops produced. I was once starstruck by the appeal of a 2 in 1, and almost invested in a HP one myself. However, there were one or two very bad reviews, and coupled with the low number of produced laptops of this type, perhaps I will wait until the technology for 2 in 1s are more advanced and reliable!\n\n## Specifications\n\nNow, I am also curious about the spread of specifications, such as CPU, RAM, Memory, GPU, OpSys. Since I am a student from CHS (FASS), and have no interest in gaming, specs such as GPU and even Operating Systems are not that important to me. Hence, let's look at how the laptops are distributed across different CPUs and RAMs, as I may consider these specs more heavily than others.\n\n### Number of Laptops by CPU types\n\nAccording to Arm, CPUs, or the Central Processing Unit, is the main component of a laptop that acts as its \"brain\", running the machine's operating systems and apps (Ltd.). It is key that we find a good CPU for a laptop that we may use for future years!\n\nGiven that there are a total of 118 unique CPUs, let's look at the more popular CPU systems; i.e. the CPUs that have been used in more than 40 laptops.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\n# Filter out CPUs with counts less than 40\nfiltered_data <- laptop_data %>%\n  group_by(Cpu) %>%\n  filter(n() > 40)\n\n# Create a new column in your dataset\nfiltered_data$cpu_category <- ifelse(filtered_data$Cpu %in% c(\"Intel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz\", \"Intel Core i7 7500U 2.7GHz\", \"Intel Core i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz\"), \"CPUs with <100 laptops\", \"Other CPUs\")\n\n# Plot using the new column\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = Cpu, fill = cpu_category)) +\n  geom_bar() + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"CPUs with <100 laptops\" = \"#C492B1\", \"Other CPUs\" = \"#6D545D\")) +\n  labs(x = \"CPU\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Number of Laptops by CPU Category (Count > 40)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\nBased on the graph, I've highlighted the CPUs with more than a 100 produced laptops. These are the Intel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz, Intel Core i7 7500U 2.7GHz, and Intel Core i7 7700HQ 2.8GH.\n\n### CPU types against Laptop Prices\n\nFor the CPUs that have been used in more than 40 laptops (i.e. the more popular CPUs), let's look at their price distribution.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\nfiltered_data_sgd <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(Price = Price * tosgd)\n# Create a new column \"cpu_group\" based on the CPU names\nfiltered_data_sgd <- filtered_data_sgd %>%\n  mutate(cpu_group = case_when(\n    Cpu %in% c(\"Intel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz\", \"Intel Core i7 7500U 2.7GHz\", \"Intel Core i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz\") ~ \"Special CPUs\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Other CPUs\"\n  ))\n\n# Plot the boxplot with the new \"cpu_group\" column for fill\nggplot(filtered_data_sgd, aes(x = Cpu, y = Price, fill = cpu_group)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"CPU\", y = \"Price\", title = \"Price vs. CPU Scatter Plot\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(500, 3000, by = 500), labels = function(x) ifelse(x %% 500 == 0, as.character(x), \"\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#6D545D\", \"#C492B1\"), labels = c(\"Other CPUs\", \"CPUs with >100 laptops\"))\n\n```\n\nLooks like the CPU that has been produced the most, IntelCore i5 7200U 2.5GHz, remain relatively affordable in its distribution of price, with its mean approaching SGD\\$1,000. The other two popular CPUs, IntelCore i7 7500U 2.7GHz and IntelCore i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz, have a pricier distribution.\n\nI do know that i7 CPUs perform better than the i5. If the price of my laptop is a bigger concern, I could start with considering the IntelCore i5 7200U 2.5GHz, but if I want a better functioning laptop, I could consider either of the identified i7s.\n\n### Number of Laptops by RAM\n\nAccording to TechTarget, RAM, or random access memory, is the hardware that provides temporary storage for the operating system (OS), software programs or other data in current use in a laptop so they are quickly accessible to the device's processor (Sheldon & Peterson, 2024). In layman terms, this means that a faster RAM will result in a laptop responding faster to your inputs!\n\nNo cleaning is needed for RAM as there are only 9 types of RAM these laptops come in -- let's look at how many laptops are produced in each RAM amount!\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\n# Define the order of RAM categories\nram_order <- c(\"2GB\", \"4GB\", \"6GB\", \"8GB\", \"12GB\", \"16GB\", \"24GB\", \"32GB\", \"64GB\")\n\n# Convert RAM to a factor with the defined order\nlaptop_data$Ram <- factor(laptop_data$Ram, levels = ram_order)\n\n# Create a bar plot for the \"Ram\" category with sorted values\nggplot(laptop_data, aes(x = Ram, fill = Ram)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#F9DC5C\", \"#E08E45\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#E08E45\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#E08E45\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#F9DC5C\"))+\n  labs(x = \"RAM\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Number of Laptops by RAM Category (Sorted)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n```\n\nLooks like the most popular RAM categories are 4GB, 8GB and 16GB, highlighted in a darker yellow! How interesting that their in-between values like 6GB, 12GB etc. are nowhere near as popular.\n\n### RAM against Laptop Prices\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\n# Define the order of RAM categories\nram_order <- c(\"2GB\", \"4GB\", \"6GB\", \"8GB\", \"12GB\", \"16GB\", \"24GB\", \"32GB\", \"64GB\")\n\n# Convert RAM to a factor with the defined order\nlaptop_data$Ram <- factor(laptop_data$Ram, levels = ram_order)\n\n\n# Create a bar plot for the \"Ram\" category with sorted values\nggplot(laptop_data, aes(x = Ram, y = Price * tosgd, fill = Ram)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"RAM\", y = \"Price\", title = \"Price vs. RAM Box Plot\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#F9DC5C\", \"#E08E45\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#E08E45\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#E08E45\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#F9DC5C\")) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n```\n\nThis seems intuitive enough -- the higher the RAM, the more expensive the laptop gets. However, according to the boxplot, it may be possible to get a 16GB RAM laptop that costs the same as another 8GB RAM laptop. We should thus consider this price range when scouting for our high-RAM laptops!\n\n## CPU against RAM\n\nNow, we know that there's a huge distribution of CPU types, and a smaller one for that of RAM. We also know that the higher the RAM GB, the more expensive the laptops tend to get. But is CPU or RAM a bigger influence over the price? Let's take a look.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\n# Define the order of RAM categories\nram_order <- c(\"2GB\", \"4GB\", \"6GB\", \"8GB\", \"12GB\", \"16GB\", \"24GB\", \"32GB\", \"64GB\")\n\n# Convert RAM to a factor with the defined order\nfiltered_data_sgd$Ram <- factor(filtered_data_sgd$Ram, levels = ram_order)\n\nggplot(filtered_data_sgd, aes(x = Cpu, y = Ram, color = Price)) +\n  geom_point(size=5) +\n  scale_colour_viridis()+\n  labs(x = \"CPU\", y = \"RAM\", color = \"Price\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\nIt looks like the RAM has a bigger influence over the price, with anything above 16GB easily costing SGD\\$2,000 and above. We also see that any CPUs with i7 Cores tend to cost a bit more, though this influence isn't stronger than that of the RAM's. Budget conscious students should thus consider sacrificing RAM speed for a better CPU.\n\n## Weight against Price\n\nNow, let's take a quick look at if weight has any correlation with price!\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\nfiltered_data_sgd <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(Price = Price * tosgd)\n\n# Scatter plot of price against weight\n# Assuming 'Weight' is a character or factor variable\n# Remove \"kg\" and convert to numeric\nfiltered_data_sgd$Weight_numeric <- as.numeric(sub(\"kg\", \"\", as.character(filtered_data_sgd$Weight)))\n\n# Now you can use 'Weight_numeric' in your ggplot\nggplot(filtered_data_sgd, aes(x = Weight_numeric, y = Price)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#5B8C5A\") +\n  labs(x = \"Weight (kg)\", y = \"Price\", title = \"Price vs. Weight Scatter Plot\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\nInterestingly, there seems to be no correlation between the weight and price. Instead, the trend appears to be that the cheaper laptops are around the 2kg mark. While lighter laptops can be a bit more costly, appearing from SGD\\$1k-2k, heavier laptops such as those above 3kg also tend to cost a bit more, with some above 4kg costing nearly SGD\\$3k.\n\nLastly, let's look at the distribution of prices, weight and inches of the laptops!\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\n\nfiltered_data_sgd$Weight_numeric <- as.numeric(sub(\"kg\", \"\", as.character(filtered_data_sgd$Weight)))\n\n\n# Create a scatter plot\nplot_ly(data = filtered_data_sgd, x = ~Inches, y = ~Weight_numeric, z = ~Price,\n        type = \"scatter3d\", mode = \"markers\", color = ~Price*tosgd,\n        marker = list(size = 5, opacity = 0.8)) %>%\n  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = \"Inches\"),\n                      yaxis = list(title = \"Weight\"),\n                      zaxis = list(title = \"Price (SGD)\")))\n```\n\nThis interactive 3D plot allows you to explore the data points as you wish. Hover above specific data points to obtain information about all 3 of its characteristic!\n\nPersonally, I find that my laptops need not be above 15 inches big. It looks like the typical 14-inch laptop can be as light as 1.1kg, and costs less than \\$1k! However, we saw from the previous plots the impact of CPU and RAM, which may have resulted in such laptops being cheaper and lighter. Perhaps a good compromise would be a 14-inch laptop approaching the \\$1k price tag. Its weight can be a negotiable factor as it depends if the individual user would be concerned over portability!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are many considerations to make when buying your next laptop. While the price of the laptop will definitely be a universal consideration among us students, we also have to strike a balance between looking at good quality laptops with durable specifications, and an affordable price point!\n\nWhile this data story hopes to give one a starting point in analysing the relationship between prices and certain specifications, greater research has to be conducted into each specification in order to discover what individual students may prefer. For example, students who are interesting in gaming laptops ought to consider GPU, a specification not included in this data story! Furthermore, the understanding of specifications covered is not comprehensive based on the data story alone. One cannot tell the experiential difference between 4GB RAM or 32GB RAM just by looking at these plots.\n\nHowever, I hope to paint a convincing enough picture so that students not well-versed in tech will not pay \\$3,000 for a laptop that only holds 4GB RAM, or an IntelCore i5 model. To be familiar with pricing trends per specification is important, so even amateur technology users will at least understand the market price of the specifications they want, and can plan their budgets accordingly!\n\nThis data story is not the holy grail to laptop solutions, but as a laptop consumer myself, it shed light onto many insights. I would not have known about the top 3 more popular RAMs in production, or that Apple produces the least number of laptops out of the more popular laptop companies out there. I hope you had fun looking through my graphs, and remember to check this website out when you next buy a laptop!\n\n## References\n\nAmer, A. R.

However, price is arguably one of the stronger factors in our wallet-friendly decisions.\n\nBefore we delve into the visualisations for each specification, here's a quick box plot of each specification we will investigate, against the prices.\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"600\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://iaekr.shinyapps.io/personal_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\nLet's break it down into simpler visualisations so we understand what it is talking about!\n\n## Number of Laptops by Company\n\nHere are the total number of laptops in the dataset, arranged by the brands that produce them!\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}\ntotal_brands_and_laptops <- laptop_data %>%\n  group_by(Company) %>%\n  tally()\n\n# Define new colors for the companies\nbrand_colors <- c(\n  \"Asus\" = \"#eac435\", \"HP\" = \"#345995\", \"Apple\" = \"#03cea4\", \n  \"Dell\" = \"#fb4d3d\", \"Lenovo\" = \"#ca1551\", \n  \"Toshiba\" = \"#a0d1e3\", \"MSI\" = \"#e1a0d1\", \"Acer\" = \"#d1a0e3\", \n  \"Samsung\" = \"#f0c2ff\", \"Sony\" = \"#f7a6c2\", \"Huawei\" = \"#ffacac\", \n  \"Google\" = \"#ffc6ac\", \"Razer\" = \"#ffd9ac\", \"Microsoft\" = \"#ffe6ac\", \n  \"Xiaomi\" = \"#fff4ac\", \"Fujitsu\" = \"#e5ffac\", \"Mediacom\" = \"#acf2ff\", \n  \"LG\" = \"#acddff\", \"Chuwi\" = \"#acaaff\"\n)\n\n# Use the new colors in your plots\nggplot(total_brands_and_laptops, aes(x = reorder(Company, n), y = n, fill = Company)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend=FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Company\", y = \"Number of Laptop Types\", title = \"Number of Laptop Types by Company\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)\n```\n\nPersonally, I have never heard of brands such as Chuwi, Mediacom or Vero. Have you seen these laptops before?\n\n![Source: Shopee](three%20unknown%20laptops.png)\n\nIt looks like Vero is an environmentally friendly laptop line from Acer! Let's merge the companies into one for clarity's sake, into a category called Acer&V.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}\ntotal_brands_and_laptops2 <- laptop_data %>%\n  mutate(Company = ifelse(Company %in% c(\"Acer\", \"Vero\"), \"Acer&V\", Company)) %>%\n  group_by(Company) %>%\n  tally()\n\n# Define new colors for the companies\nbrand_colors <- c(\n  \"Asus\" = \"#eac435\", \"HP\" = \"#345995\", \"Apple\" = \"#03cea4\", \n  \"Dell\" = \"#fb4d3d\", \"Lenovo\" = \"#ca1551\", \n  \"Toshiba\" = \"#a0d1e3\", \"MSI\" = \"#e1a0d1\", \"Acer&V\" = \"#d1a0e3\", \n  \"Samsung\" = \"#f0c2ff\", \"Sony\" = \"#f7a6c2\", \"Huawei\" = \"#ffacac\", \n  \"Google\" = \"#ffc6ac\", \"Razer\" = \"#ffd9ac\", \"Microsoft\" = \"#ffe6ac\", \n  \"Xiaomi\" = \"#fff4ac\", \"Fujitsu\" = \"#e5ffac\", \"Mediacom\" = \"#acf2ff\", \n  \"LG\" = \"#acddff\", \"Chuwi\" = \"#acaaff\"\n)\n\n# Use the new colors in your plots\nggplot(total_brands_and_laptops2, aes(x = reorder(Company, n), y = n, fill = Company)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend=FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Company\", y = \"Number of Laptop Types\", title = \"Number of Laptop Types by Company\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)\n```\n\nThere are also many, many companies that produced very little laptops, and I doubt that I would want to buy from these brands. Thus, they're not relevant to my analysis. I removed brands who produced less than 20 laptops from the data set.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}\nlaptop_data2 <- laptop_data %>%\n  mutate(Company = ifelse(Company %in% c(\"Acer\", \"Vero\"), \"Acer&V\", Company)) \n\nbrand_nos <- laptop_data2 %>% \n  group_by(Company) %>% \n  tally() %>% \n  filter(n>10) %>% \n  arrange(desc(n))\n\n# Define new colors for the companies\nbrand_colors <- c(\n  \"Asus\" = \"#eac435\", \"HP\" = \"#345995\", \"Apple\" = \"#03cea4\", \n  \"Dell\" = \"#fb4d3d\", \"Lenovo\" = \"#ca1551\", \n  \"Toshiba\" = \"#a0d1e3\", \"MSI\" = \"#e1a0d1\", \"Acer&V\" = \"#d1a0e3\", \n  \"Samsung\" = \"#f0c2ff\", \"Sony\" = \"#f7a6c2\", \"Huawei\" = \"#ffacac\", \n  \"Google\" = \"#ffc6ac\", \"Razer\" = \"#ffd9ac\", \"Microsoft\" = \"#ffe6ac\", \n  \"Xiaomi\" = \"#fff4ac\", \"Fujitsu\" = \"#e5ffac\", \"Mediacom\" = \"#acf2ff\", \n  \"LG\" = \"#acddff\", \"Chuwi\" = \"#acaaff\"\n)\n\n#only 9 brands\nggplot(brand_nos, aes(x = reorder(Company, n), y = n, fill = Company)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x = \"Company\", y = \"Number of Laptops\", title = \"Number of Laptops Produced by Each Company\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)\n```\n\nMuch better!\n\n### Company against Laptop Price\n\nBelow is the plot of the **number of computers** each **company** produces against the **price of each unit of computers**. Here, we can see which company tends to produce more affordable ranges of computers, and which company tends to produce more expensive range of computers.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\nbrand_quantity <- laptop_data %>% \n  select(Company, Weight, Price) %>% \n  group_by(Company) %>% \n  mutate(count = n()) %>% \n  filter(count>10) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  select(-count)\n\ntosgd <- 0.016\ntousd <- 0.012\n\nbrand_quantity <- brand_quantity %>% \n  mutate(Price = Price * tousd)\n\n#ggplot(brand_quantity, aes(x = Price, y = Company)) + geom_boxplot()\nggplot(brand_quantity, aes(x = Price, y = reorder(Company, Price), fill = Company)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Price\", y = \"Company\") +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)\n```\n\nWe observe some outliers in the data. In the above box plot, while the whiskers of each box vary, there are some data points that indiciate one or two abnormally expensive computers that lie beyond even the maximum value of the range of computers.\n\nFor example, Lenovo produces one laptop that costs more than \\$3,000, unusual as their line of laptops usually range from less than \\$500 to less than \\$1,000. ASUS also produces two computers that cost around \\$1,500, despite its range of products largely falling under \\$1,000. We can also see that Apple and MSI are the most consistent in their pricings, as there are no outliers in their box plots. They also happen to have the highest mean prices for their laptops, alongside Toshiba.\n\n## Number of Laptop Types by Category of Laptops\n\nWhile we can look at the data through the lens of the company that produces them, we can also investigate the data through the Category of Laptops.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\ntypename_colour <- c(\n  \"2 in 1 Convertible\" = \"#E3B505\", \"Gaming\" = \"#95190C\", \"Netbook\" = \"#610345\", \"Notebook\" = \"#107E7D\", \"Ultrabook\"=\"#044B7F\", \"Workstation\"=\"#D72638\"\n)\n\nggplot(laptop_data, aes(x = TypeName, fill = TypeName)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Category\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Number of laptops against Category of Laptops\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = typename_colour)\n```\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Notebook category wins by a landslide in terms of quantity produced, with more than 650 types produced. On the other hand, Netbooks and Workstations are lesser produced, and perhaps this means there is a small demand for such laptops!\n\nCuriously, there are only a little more than 100 2 in 1 Convertible laptops produced. I was once starstruck by the appeal of a 2 in 1, and almost invested in a HP one myself. However, there were one or two very bad reviews, and coupled with the low number of produced laptops of this type, perhaps I will wait until the technology for 2 in 1s are more advanced and reliable!\n\n## Specifications\n\nNow, I am also curious about the spread of specifications, such as CPU, RAM, Memory, GPU, OpSys. Since I am a student from CHS (FASS), and have no interest in gaming, specs such as GPU and even Operating Systems are not that important to me. Hence, let's look at how the laptops are distributed across different CPUs and RAMs, as I may consider these specs more heavily than others.\n\n### Number of Laptops by CPU types\n\nAccording to Arm, CPUs, or the Central Processing Unit, is the main component of a laptop that acts as its \"brain\", running the machine's operating systems and apps (Ltd.). It is key that we find a good CPU for a laptop that we may use for future years!\n\nGiven that there are a total of 118 unique CPUs, let's look at the more popular CPU systems; i.e. the CPUs that have been used in more than 40 laptops.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\n# Filter out CPUs with counts less than 40\nfiltered_data <- laptop_data %>%\n  group_by(Cpu) %>%\n  filter(n() > 40)\n\n# Create a new column in your dataset\nfiltered_data$cpu_category <- ifelse(filtered_data$Cpu %in% c(\"Intel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz\", \"Intel Core i7 7500U 2.7GHz\", \"Intel Core i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz\"), \"CPUs with <100 laptops\", \"Other CPUs\")\n\n# Plot using the new column\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = Cpu, fill = cpu_category)) +\n  geom_bar() + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"CPUs with <100 laptops\" = \"#C492B1\", \"Other CPUs\" = \"#6D545D\")) +\n  labs(x = \"CPU\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Number of Laptops by CPU Category (Count > 40)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\nBased on the graph, I've highlighted the CPUs with more than a 100 produced laptops. These are the Intel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz, Intel Core i7 7500U 2.7GHz, and Intel Core i7 7700HQ 2.8GH.\n\n### CPU types against Laptop Prices\n\nFor the CPUs that have been used in more than 40 laptops (i.e. the more popular CPUs), let's look at their price distribution.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\nfiltered_data_sgd <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(Price = Price * tosgd)\n# Create a new column \"cpu_group\" based on the CPU names\nfiltered_data_sgd <- filtered_data_sgd %>%\n  mutate(cpu_group = case_when(\n    Cpu %in% c(\"Intel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz\", \"Intel Core i7 7500U 2.7GHz\", \"Intel Core i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz\") ~ \"Special CPUs\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Other CPUs\"\n  ))\n\n# Plot the boxplot with the new \"cpu_group\" column for fill\nggplot(filtered_data_sgd, aes(x = Cpu, y = Price, fill = cpu_group)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"CPU\", y = \"Price\", title = \"Price vs. CPU Scatter Plot\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(500, 3000, by = 500), labels = function(x) ifelse(x %% 500 == 0, as.character(x), \"\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#6D545D\", \"#C492B1\"), labels = c(\"Other CPUs\", \"CPUs with >100 laptops\"))\n\n```\n\nLooks like the CPU that has been produced the most, IntelCore i5 7200U 2.5GHz, remain relatively affordable in its distribution of price, with its mean approaching SGD\\$1,000. The other two popular CPUs, IntelCore i7 7500U 2.7GHz and IntelCore i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz, have a pricier distribution.\n\nI do know that i7 CPUs perform better than the i5. If the price of my laptop is a bigger concern, I could start with considering the IntelCore i5 7200U 2.5GHz, but if I want a better functioning laptop, I could consider either of the identified i7s.\n\n### Number of Laptops by RAM\n\nAccording to TechTarget, RAM, or random access memory, is the hardware that provides temporary storage for the operating system (OS), software programs or other data in current use in a laptop so they are quickly accessible to the device's processor (Sheldon & Peterson, 2024). In layman terms, this means that a faster RAM will result in a laptop responding faster to your inputs!\n\nNo cleaning is needed for RAM as there are only 9 types of RAM these laptops come in -- let's look at how many laptops are produced in each RAM amount!\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\n# Define the order of RAM categories\nram_order <- c(\"2GB\", \"4GB\", \"6GB\", \"8GB\", \"12GB\", \"16GB\", \"24GB\", \"32GB\", \"64GB\")\n\n# Convert RAM to a factor with the defined order\nlaptop_data$Ram <- factor(laptop_data$Ram, levels = ram_order)\n\n# Create a bar plot for the \"Ram\" category with sorted values\nggplot(laptop_data, aes(x = Ram, fill = Ram)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#F9DC5C\", \"#E08E45\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#E08E45\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#E08E45\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#F9DC5C\"))+\n  labs(x = \"RAM\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Number of Laptops by RAM Category (Sorted)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n```\n\nLooks like the most popular RAM categories are 4GB, 8GB and 16GB, highlighted in a darker yellow! How interesting that their in-between values like 6GB, 12GB etc. are nowhere near as popular.\n\n### RAM against Laptop Prices\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\n# Define the order of RAM categories\nram_order <- c(\"2GB\", \"4GB\", \"6GB\", \"8GB\", \"12GB\", \"16GB\", \"24GB\", \"32GB\", \"64GB\")\n\n# Convert RAM to a factor with the defined order\nlaptop_data$Ram <- factor(laptop_data$Ram, levels = ram_order)\n\n\n# Create a bar plot for the \"Ram\" category with sorted values\nggplot(laptop_data, aes(x = Ram, y = Price * tosgd, fill = Ram)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"RAM\", y = \"Price\", title = \"Price vs. RAM Box Plot\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#F9DC5C\", \"#E08E45\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#E08E45\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#E08E45\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#F9DC5C\", \"#F9DC5C\")) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n```\n\nThis seems intuitive enough -- the higher the RAM, the more expensive the laptop gets. However, according to the boxplot, it may be possible to get a 16GB RAM laptop that costs the same as another 8GB RAM laptop. We should thus consider this price range when scouting for our high-RAM laptops!\n\n## CPU against RAM\n\nNow, we know that there's a huge distribution of CPU types, and a smaller one for that of RAM. We also know that the higher the RAM GB, the more expensive the laptops tend to get. But is CPU or RAM a bigger influence over the price? Let's take a look.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\n# Define the order of RAM categories\nram_order <- c(\"2GB\", \"4GB\", \"6GB\", \"8GB\", \"12GB\", \"16GB\", \"24GB\", \"32GB\", \"64GB\")\n\n# Convert RAM to a factor with the defined order\nfiltered_data_sgd$Ram <- factor(filtered_data_sgd$Ram, levels = ram_order)\n\nggplot(filtered_data_sgd, aes(x = Cpu, y = Ram, color = Price)) +\n  geom_point(size=5) +\n  scale_colour_viridis()+\n  labs(x = \"CPU\", y = \"RAM\", color = \"Price\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\nIt looks like the RAM has a bigger influence over the price, with anything above 16GB easily costing SGD\\$2,000 and above. We also see that any CPUs with i7 Cores tend to cost a bit more, though this influence isn't stronger than that of the RAM's. Budget conscious students should thus consider sacrificing RAM speed for a better CPU.\n\n## Weight against Price\n\nNow, let's take a quick look at if weight has any correlation with price!\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\nfiltered_data_sgd <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(Price = Price * tosgd)\n\n# Scatter plot of price against weight\n# Assuming 'Weight' is a character or factor variable\n# Remove \"kg\" and convert to numeric\nfiltered_data_sgd$Weight_numeric <- as.numeric(sub(\"kg\", \"\", as.character(filtered_data_sgd$Weight)))\n\n# Now you can use 'Weight_numeric' in your ggplot\nggplot(filtered_data_sgd, aes(x = Weight_numeric, y = Price)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#5B8C5A\") +\n  labs(x = \"Weight (kg)\", y = \"Price\", title = \"Price vs. Weight Scatter Plot\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\nInterestingly, there seems to be no correlation between the weight and price. Instead, the trend appears to be that the cheaper laptops are around the 2kg mark. While lighter laptops can be a bit more costly, appearing from SGD\\$1k-2k, heavier laptops such as those above 3kg also tend to cost a bit more, with some above 4kg costing nearly SGD\\$3k.\n\nLastly, let's look at the distribution of prices, weight and inches of the laptops!\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\n\nfiltered_data_sgd$Weight_numeric <- as.numeric(sub(\"kg\", \"\", as.character(filtered_data_sgd$Weight)))\n\n\n# Create a scatter plot\nplot_ly(data = filtered_data_sgd, x = ~Inches, y = ~Weight_numeric, z = ~Price,\n        type = \"scatter3d\", mode = \"markers\", color = ~Price*tosgd,\n        marker = list(size = 5, opacity = 0.8)) %>%\n  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = \"Inches\"),\n                      yaxis = list(title = \"Weight\"),\n                      zaxis = list(title = \"Price (SGD)\")))\n```\n\nThis interactive 3D plot allows you to explore the data points as you wish. Hover above specific data points to obtain information about all 3 of its characteristic!\n\nPersonally, I find that my laptops need not be above 15 inches big. It looks like the typical 14-inch laptop can be as light as 1.1kg, and costs less than \\$1k! However, we saw from the previous plots the impact of CPU and RAM, which may have resulted in such laptops being cheaper and lighter. Perhaps a good compromise would be a 14-inch laptop approaching the \\$1k price tag. Its weight can be a negotiable factor as it depends if the individual user would be concerned over portability!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are many considerations to make when buying your next laptop. While the price of the laptop will definitely be a universal consideration among us students, we also have to strike a balance between looking at good quality laptops with durable specifications, and an affordable price point!\n\nWhile this data story hopes to give one a starting point in analysing the relationship between prices and certain specifications, greater research has to be conducted into each specification in order to discover what individual students may prefer. For example, students who are interesting in gaming laptops ought to consider GPU, a specification not included in this data story! Furthermore, the understanding of specifications covered is not comprehensive based on the data story alone. One cannot tell the experiential difference between 4GB RAM or 32GB RAM just by looking at these plots.\n\nHowever, I hope to paint a convincing enough picture so that students not well-versed in tech will not pay \\$3,000 for a laptop that only holds 4GB RAM, or an IntelCore i5 model. To be familiar with pricing trends per specification is important, so even amateur technology users will at least understand the market price of the specifications they want, and can plan their budgets accordingly!\n\nThis data story is not the holy grail to laptop solutions, but as a laptop consumer myself, it shed light onto many insights. I would not have known about the top 3 more popular RAMs in production, or that Apple produces the least number of laptops out of the more popular laptop companies out there. I hope you had fun looking through my graphs, and remember to check this website out when you next buy a laptop!\n\n## References\n\nAmer, A. R.
