I will attempt to answer the question: How many types of laptops do each brand make, and which brands make the most expensive and most affordable types of laptops?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 1,303\nColumns: 12\n$ X                <int> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,…\n$ Company          <chr> \"Apple\", \"Apple\", \"HP\", \"Apple\", \"Apple\", \"Acer\", \"Ap…\n$ TypeName         <chr> \"Ultrabook\", \"Ultrabook\", \"Notebook\", \"Ultrabook\", \"U…\n$ Inches           <dbl> 13.3, 13.3, 15.6, 15.4, 13.3, 15.6, 15.4, 13.3, 14.0,…\n$ ScreenResolution <chr> \"IPS Panel Retina Display 2560x1600\", \"1440x900\", \"Fu…\n$ Cpu              <chr> \"Intel Core i5 2.3GHz\", \"Intel Core i5 1.8GHz\", \"Inte…\n$ Ram              <chr> \"8GB\", \"8GB\", \"8GB\", \"16GB\", \"8GB\", \"4GB\", \"16GB\", \"8…\n$ Memory           <chr> \"128GB SSD\", \"128GB Flash Storage\", \"256GB SSD\", \"512…\n$ Gpu              <chr> \"Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640\", \"Intel HD Graphics 60…\n$ OpSys            <chr> \"macOS\", \"macOS\", \"No OS\", \"macOS\", \"macOS\", \"Windows…\n$ Weight           <chr> \"1.37kg\", \"1.34kg\", \"1.86kg\", \"1.83kg\", \"1.37kg\", \"2.…\n$ Price            <dbl> 71378.68, 47895.52, 30636.00, 135195.34, 96095.81, 21…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the glimpse of the dataset here, we see that it includes many specifications such as CPU, Ram, Memory, GPU, the type of Operating System and even Weight, which I had originally intended to use in visualising their effects on the pricing of each computer.

The few laptop types they produced would also make it difficult to create any conclusive data trends about their products. Hence, I removed brands who produced less than 20 laptops from the dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'fixerapi' was built under R version 4.3.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nNew names:\nRows: 1303 Columns: 12\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(9): Company, TypeName, ScreenResolution, Cpu, Ram, Memory, Gpu, OpSys, ... dbl\n(3): ...1, Inches, Price\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -> `...1`\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 8 × 2\n  Company     n\n  <chr>   <int>\n1 Dell      297\n2 Lenovo    297\n3 HP        274\n4 Asus      158\n5 Acer      103\n6 MSI        54\n7 Toshiba    48\n8 Apple      21\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nBelow is a horizontal table plot of the number of type of laptops that the 8 surviving companies produced.

Here, we can see which company tends to produce more affordable ranges of computers, and which company tends to produce more expensive range of computers.\\\n\\\nWe observe some outliers in the data as well. In this box plot, while the whiskers of each box vary, there are some data points that indiciate one or two abnormally expensive computers that lie beyond even the maximum value of the range of computers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor example, Lenovo produces one laptop that costs more than \\$3,000, unusual as their line of laptops usually range from less than \\$500 to less than \\$1,000. ASUS also produces two computers that cost around \\$1,500, despite its range of products largely falling under \\$1,000. We can also see that Apple and MSI are the most consistent in their pricings, as there are no outliers in their box plots. They also happen to have the highest mean prices for their laptops, alongside Toshiba.\n\nBelow is the interactive boxplot that allows users to toggle between currencies of the prices, namely between IND (in which the original data came in), SGD and USD.\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://iaekr.shinyapps.io/sample_app_nm2207/\"> </iframe>\n```\n",
