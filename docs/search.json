    "text": "Are you a student with little knowledge of tech? Or are you not sure where to start with your next laptop purchase? Want to look into other options aside from expensive Macbooks?\nAs students, our digital devices are key to our success in school. According to UNiDAYS, 97% of students say that their laptop is vital to their academic success, and 88% of students do research before buying their laptops (UNiDAYS, 2021). However, a significant 65% of students base their next laptop decision off of their previous experiences (UNiDAYS, 2021). This shows that we may be unaware about the options available out there, especially if we have not tried a variety of laptops before.\nBuying a wrong laptop would be a costly decision as well. We are budget-strapped students after all!\n\n\n\nSource: BAM Agency\n\n\nThus, welcome to my data story, where I take you through the analysis of a csv file, where we can both gain some insights about laptop brands, specifications, prices, and even its weight! Through this journey, I hope we both gain an awareness of what types of laptops there are, and what categories to begin our search in the next time we find ourselves in need of a laptop.\nPersonally, I’m interested in finding what the most common specs are (i.e. the most basic laptop models) – that would mark a good place for me to start looking into laptops, and I could start looking for affordable options with the same specs, or for any specific or different specs I may need.\n\n\n\nSource: vGeek\n\n\n\n\nWith the data set named “Laptop Prices Based on its specifications “ by user Abdul Rehman Amer from the website Kaggle (Amer, 2024), we can look at every computer that is manufactured this year.\nBelow is the summary of the data set at hand. There are a total of 12 columns, and we can look each laptop’s Company (or brand name), TypeName (Category of laptop), Inches (size of laptop), ScreenResolution (Screen Size), CPU, RAM, Memory, GPU, OpSys, Weight, and Price!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\nCompany\nTypeName\nInches\nScreenResolution\nCpu\nRam\nMemory\nGpu\nOpSys\nWeight\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n0\nApple\nUltrabook\n13.3\nIPS Panel Retina Display 2560x1600\nIntel Core i5 2.3GHz\n8GB\n128GB SSD\nIntel Iris Plus Graphics 640\nmacOS\n1.37kg\n71378.68\n\n\n1\nApple\nUltrabook\n13.3\n1440x900\nIntel Core i5 1.8GHz\n8GB\n128GB Flash Storage\nIntel HD Graphics 6000\nmacOS\n1.34kg\n47895.52\n\n\n2\nHP\nNotebook\n15.6\nFull HD 1920x1080\nIntel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz\n8GB\n256GB SSD\nIntel HD Graphics 620\nNo OS\n1.86kg\n30636.00\n\n\n3\nApple\nUltrabook\n15.4\nIPS Panel Retina Display 2880x1800\nIntel Core i7 2.7GHz\n16GB\n512GB SSD\nAMD Radeon Pro 455\nmacOS\n1.83kg\n135195.34\n\n\n4\nApple\nUltrabook\n13.3\nIPS Panel Retina Display 2560x1600\nIntel Core i5 3.1GHz\n8GB\n256GB SSD\nIntel Iris Plus Graphics 650\nmacOS\n1.37kg\n96095.81\n\n\n5\nAcer\nNotebook\n15.6\n1366x768\nAMD A9-Series 9420 3GHz\n4GB\n500GB HDD\nAMD Radeon R5\nWindows 10\n2.1kg\n21312.00\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is just a snippet of the entire data set. As individuals who may have different intentions in what they will do with their laptops, e.g. code, graphic design, gaming, writing essays, streaming videos, there is a number of specifications we may look at. However, price is arguably one of the stronger factors in our wallet-friendly decisions.\nBefore we delve into the visualisations for each specification, here’s a quick box plot of each specification we will investigate, against the prices.\n \nLet’s break it down into simpler visualisations so we understand what it is talking about!\n\n\n\nHere are the total number of laptops in the dataset, arranged by the brands that produce them!\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, I have never heard of brands such as Chuwi, Mediacom or Vero. Have you seen these laptops before?\n\n\n\nSource: Shopee\n\n\nIt looks like Vero is an environmentally friendly laptop line from Acer! Let’s merge the companies into one for clarity’s sake, into a category called Acer&V.\nThere are also many, many companies that produced very little laptops, and I doubt that I would want to buy from these brands. Thus, they’re not relevant to my analysis. I removed brands who produced less than 20 laptops from the data set.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch better!\n\n\nBelow is the plot of the number of computers each company produces against the price of each unit of computers. Here, we can see which company tends to produce more affordable ranges of computers, and which company tends to produce more expensive range of computers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe some outliers in the data. In the above box plot, while the whiskers of each box vary, there are some data points that indiciate one or two abnormally expensive computers that lie beyond even the maximum value of the range of computers.\nFor example, Lenovo produces one laptop that costs more than $3,000, unusual as their line of laptops usually range from less than $500 to less than $1,000. ASUS also produces two computers that cost around $1,500, despite its range of products largely falling under $1,000. We can also see that Apple and MSI are the most consistent in their pricings, as there are no outliers in their box plots. They also happen to have the highest mean prices for their laptops, alongside Toshiba.\n\n\n\n\nWhile we can look at the data through the lens of the company that produces them, we can also investigate the data through the Category of Laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Notebook category wins by a landslide in terms of quantity produced, with more than 650 types produced. On the other hand, Netbooks and Workstations are lesser produced, and perhaps this means there is a small demand for such laptops!\nCuriously, there are only a little more than 100 2 in 1 Convertible laptops produced. I was once starstruck by the appeal of a 2 in 1, and almost invested in a HP one myself. However, there were one or two very bad reviews, and coupled with the low number of produced laptops of this type, perhaps I will wait until the technology for 2 in 1s are more advanced and reliable!\n\n\n\nNow, I am also curious about the spread of specifications, such as CPU, RAM, Memory, GPU, OpSys. Since I am a student from CHS (FASS), and have no interest in gaming, specs such as GPU and even Operating Systems are not that important to me. Hence, let’s look at how the laptops are distributed across different CPUs and RAMs, as I may consider these specs more heavily than others.\n\n\nAccording to Arm, CPUs, or the Central Processing Unit, is the main component of a laptop that acts as its “brain”, running the machine’s operating systems and apps (Ltd.). It is key that we find a good CPU for a laptop that we may use for future years!\nGiven that there are a total of 118 unique CPUs, let’s look at the more popular CPU systems; i.e. the CPUs that have been used in more than 40 laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the graph, I’ve highlighted the CPUs with more than a 100 produced laptops. These are the Intel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz, Intel Core i7 7500U 2.7GHz, and Intel Core i7 7700HQ 2.8GH.\n\n\n\nFor the CPUs that have been used in more than 40 laptops (i.e. the more popular CPUs), let’s look at their price distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks like the CPU that has been produced the most, IntelCore i5 7200U 2.5GHz, remain relatively affordable in its distribution of price, with its mean approaching SGD$1,000. The other two popular CPUs, IntelCore i7 7500U 2.7GHz and IntelCore i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz, have a pricier distribution.\nI do know that i7 CPUs perform better than the i5. If the price of my laptop is a bigger concern, I could start with considering the IntelCore i5 7200U 2.5GHz, but if I want a better functioning laptop, I could consider either of the identified i7s.\n\n\n\nAccording to TechTarget, RAM, or random access memory, is the hardware that provides temporary storage for the operating system (OS), software programs or other data in current use in a laptop so they are quickly accessible to the device’s processor (Sheldon & Peterson, 2024). In layman terms, this means that a faster RAM will result in a laptop responding faster to your inputs!\nNo cleaning is needed for RAM as there are only 9 types of RAM these laptops come in – let’s look at how many laptops are produced in each RAM amount!\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks like the most popular RAM categories are 4GB, 8GB and 16GB, highlighted in a darker yellow! How interesting that their in-between values like 6GB, 12GB etc. are nowhere near as popular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis seems intuitive enough – the higher the RAM, the more expensive the laptop gets. However, according to the boxplot, it may be possible to get a 16GB RAM laptop that costs the same as another 8GB RAM laptop. We should thus consider this price range when scouting for our high-RAM laptops!\n\n\n\n\nNow, we know that there’s a huge distribution of CPU types, and a smaller one for that of RAM. We also know that the higher the RAM GB, the more expensive the laptops tend to get. But is CPU or RAM a bigger influence over the price? Let’s take a look.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the RAM has a bigger influence over the price, with anything above 16GB easily costing SGD$2,000 and above. We also see that any CPUs with i7 Cores tend to cost a bit more, though this influence isn’t stronger than that of the RAM’s. Budget conscious students should thus consider sacrificing RAM speed for a better CPU.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s take a quick look at if weight has any correlation with price!\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, there seems to be no correlation between the weight and price. Instead, the trend appears to be that the cheaper laptops are around the 2kg mark. While lighter laptops can be a bit more costly, appearing from SGD$1k-2k, heavier laptops such as those above 3kg also tend to cost a bit more, with some above 4kg costing nearly SGD$3k.\nLastly, let’s look at the distribution of prices, weight and inches of the laptops!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive 3D plot allows you to explore the data points as you wish. Hover above specific data points to obtain information about all 3 of its characteristic!\nPersonally, I find that my laptops need not be above 15 inches big. It looks like the typical 14-inch laptop can be as light as 1.1kg, and costs less than $1k! However, we saw from the previous plots the impact of CPU and RAM, which may have resulted in such laptops being cheaper and lighter. Perhaps a good compromise would be a 14-inch laptop approaching the $1k price tag. Its weight can be a negotiable factor as it depends if the individual user would be concerned over portability!\n\n\n\nThere are many considerations to make when buying your next laptop. While the price of the laptop will definitely be a universal consideration among us students, we also have to strike a balance between looking at good quality laptops with durable specifications, and an affordable price point!\nWhile this data story hopes to give one a starting point in analysing the relationship between prices and certain specifications, greater research has to be conducted into each specification in order to discover what individual students may prefer. For example, students who are interesting in gaming laptops ought to consider GPU, a specification not included in this data story! Furthermore, the understanding of specifications covered is not comprehensive based on the data story alone. One cannot tell the experiential difference between 4GB RAM or 32GB RAM just by looking at these plots.\nHowever, I hope to paint a convincing enough picture so that students not well-versed in tech will not pay $3,000 for a laptop that only holds 4GB RAM, or an IntelCore i5 model. To be familiar with pricing trends per specification is important, so even amateur technology users will at least understand the market price of the specifications they want, and can plan their budgets accordingly!\nThis data story is not the holy grail to laptop solutions, but as a laptop consumer myself, it shed light onto many insights. I would not have known about the top 3 more popular RAMs in production, or that Apple produces the least number of laptops out of the more popular laptop companies out there. I hope you had fun looking through my graphs, and remember to check this website out when you next buy a laptop!\n\n\n\nAmer, A. R. (2024, March 18). Laptop prices based on its specifications.

    "text": "Identified problem statement\nI will attempt to answer the question: How many types of laptops do each brand make, and which brands make the most expensive and most affordable types of laptops?\nAs everyday students who may not understand laptops intimately, when we intend on buying a new laptop, we look at the different types of laptop brands or companies that we heard from word of mouth, or by briefly searching for reviews online. As such, only the most prominent or famous brands stick out (such as Apple or Lenovo), and we never gain a truly representative overview of the types of laptops out there.\nAs this is typically a big expenditure for students, students should be well informed when making their decision, taking into account the brand reputation, specifications and brand of the laptop. In order to tackle the problem that the everyday student may not have a thorough overview of their options, I have decided to perform data visualisation with this data.\n\n#make this less wordy.

However, I realised that these are mostly categorical variables, which is difficult to convert into numerical variables that we can perform meaningful data analysis on.\nHence, I decided to focus on the company producing the laptops, arriving at the problem statement outlined above. In the dataset, there are a total of 19 companies that produce laptops. This can be seen in the data visualisation below.\nHowever, there are some companies that produced very little laptops, and I felt they were not relevant to the total analysis, since the popularity of their products would likely be lower. The few laptop types they produced would also make it difficult to create any conclusive data trends about their products. Hence, I removed brands who produced less than 20 laptops from the dataset."

    "text": "As a result, we can see from our graphs that comparatively, Lenovo, Dell and HP are brands that produce the most variety of laptops. Surprisingly, Apple, a popular consumer option for laptops, produce the least variety of laptops. We learn through this data that while purchasing from Apple may be a tempting option to go for, as they are known for their versatility in function, there is a chance that Lenovo, HP or Dell would have produced a laptop that met a student’s specific needs.\nBut why do we need to consider other laptop brands if Apple usually does the job? This is because Apple’s average price point, as seen in the second plot, is higher than the averages of the other companies. This indicates that there is a good chance that the laptop you are eyeing from Apple, while it may get the job done, may be excessively expensive. If one is tight on budget, it would be advisable for them to delve into Lenovo, HP or Dell for more varied options.\nMSI is a brand that has a higher mean price for their laptops than even Apple, making their laptops the most expensive out of all visible. However, this is likely because they produce gaming laptops, which tend to have higher specs for optimal gameplay, thus adding to the price point of their products.\n\n#make some sort of visualisation?"

They also happen to have the highest mean prices for their laptops, alongside Toshiba.\nBelow is the interactive boxplot that allows users to toggle between currencies of the prices, namely between IND (in which the original data came in), SGD and USD.\n \n\n\n\nFor the CPUs that have been used in more than 40 laptops (i.e. the more popular CPUs), let’s look at their price distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks like the CPU that has been produced the most, IntelCore i5 7200U 2.5GHz, remain relatively affordable in its distribution of price, with its mean approaching SGD$1,000. The other two popular CPUs, IntelCore i7 7500U 2.7GHz and IntelCore i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz, have a pricier distribution.\nI do know that i7 CPUs perform better than the i5. If the price of my laptop is a bigger concern, I could start with considering the IntelCore i5 7200U 2.5GHz, but if I want a higher functioning laptop, I could consider either of the identified i7s."

Instead, the trend appears to be that the cheaper laptops are around the 2kg mark. While lighter laptops can be a bit more costly, appearing from SGD$1k-2k, heavier laptops such as those above 3kg also tend to cost a bit more, with some above 4kg costing nearly SGD$3k.\nLastly, let’s look at the distribution of prices, weight and inches of the laptops!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive 3D plot allows you to explore the data points as you wish. Hover above specific data points to obtain information about all 3 of its characteristic!\nPersonally, I find that my laptops need not be above 15 inches big. It looks like the typical 14-inch laptop can be as light as 1.1kg, and costs less than $1k! However, we saw from the previous plots the impact of CPU and RAM, which may have resulted in such laptops being cheaper and lighter. Perhaps a good compromise would be a 14-inch laptop approaching the $1k price tag. Its weight can be a negotiable factor as it depends if the individual user would be concerned over portability!"

However, I realised that these are mostly categorical variables, which is difficult to convert into numerical variables that we can perform meaningful data analysis on.\nHence, I decided to focus on the company producing the laptops, arriving at the problem statement outlined above. In the dataset, there are a total of 19 companies that produce laptops. This can be seen in the data visualisation below.\nHowever, there are some companies that produced very little laptops, and I felt they were not relevant to the total analysis, since the popularity of their products would likely be lower. The few laptop types they produced would also make it difficult to create any conclusive data trends about their products. Hence, I removed brands who produced less than 20 laptops from the dataset."

We also see that any CPUs with i7 Cores tend to cost a bit more, though this influence isn’t stronger than that of the RAM’s.

On the other hand, Netbooks and Workstations are lesser produced, and perhaps this means there is a small demand for such laptops!\nCuriously, there are only a little more than 100 2 in 1 Convertible laptops produced. I was once starstruck by the appeal of a 2 in 1, and almost invested in a HP one myself. However, there were one or two very bad reviews, and coupled with the low number of produced laptops of this type, perhaps I will wait until the technology for 2 in 1s are more advanced and reliable!"

    "text": "Now, I am also curious about the spread of specifications, such as CPU, RAM, Memory, GPU, OpSys. Since I am a student from CHS (FASS), and have no interest in gaming, specs such as GPU and even Operating Systems are not that important to me. Hence, let’s look at how the laptops are distributed across different CPUs and RAMs, as I may consider these specs more heavily than others.\n\n\nAccording to Arm, CPUs, or the Central Processing Unit, is the main component of a laptop that acts as its “brain”, running the machine’s operating systems and apps (Ltd.). It is key that we find a good CPU for a laptop that we may use for future years!\nGiven that there are a total of 118 unique CPUs, let’s look at the more popular CPU systems; i.e. the CPUs that have been used in more than 40 laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the graph, I’ve highlighted the CPUs with more than a 100 produced laptops. These are the Intel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz, Intel Core i7 7500U 2.7GHz, and Intel Core i7 7700HQ 2.8GH.\n\n\n\nFor the CPUs that have been used in more than 40 laptops (i.e. the more popular CPUs), let’s look at their price distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks like the CPU that has been produced the most, IntelCore i5 7200U 2.5GHz, remain relatively affordable in its distribution of price, with its mean approaching SGD$1,000.

If the price of my laptop is a bigger concern, I could start with considering the IntelCore i5 7200U 2.5GHz, but if I want a better functioning laptop, I could consider either of the identified i7s.\n\n\n\nAccording to TechTarget, RAM, or random access memory, is the hardware that provides temporary storage for the operating system (OS), software programs or other data in current use in a laptop so they are quickly accessible to the device’s processor (Sheldon & Peterson, 2024). In layman terms, this means that a faster RAM will result in a laptop responding faster to your inputs!\nNo cleaning is needed for RAM as there are only 9 types of RAM these laptops come in – let’s look at how many laptops are produced in each RAM amount!\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks like the most popular RAM categories are 4GB, 8GB and 16GB, highlighted in a darker yellow! How interesting that their in-between values like 6GB, 12GB etc. are nowhere near as popular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis seems intuitive enough – the higher the RAM, the more expensive the laptop gets. However, according to the boxplot, it may be possible to get a 16GB RAM laptop that costs the same as another 8GB RAM laptop. We should thus consider this price range when scouting for our high-RAM laptops!"

    "text": "There are many considerations to make when buying your next laptop. While the price of the laptop will definitely be a universal consideration among us students, we also have to strike a balance between looking at good quality laptops with durable specifications, and an affordable price point!\nWhile this data story hopes to give one a starting point in analysing the relationship between prices and certain specifications, greater research has to be conducted into each specification in order to discover what individual students may prefer. For example, students who are interesting in gaming laptops ought to consider GPU, a specification not included in this data story! Furthermore, the understanding of specifications covered is not comprehensive based on the data story alone. One cannot tell the experiential difference between 4GB RAM or 32GB RAM just by looking at these plots.\nHowever, I hope to paint a convincing enough picture so that students not well-versed in tech will not pay $3,000 for a laptop that only holds 4GB RAM, or an IntelCore i5 model. To be familiar with pricing trends per specification is important, so even amateur technology users will at least understand the market price of the specifications they want, and can plan their budgets accordingly!\nThis data story is not the holy grail to laptop solutions, but as a laptop consumer myself, it shed light onto many insights. I would not have known about the top 3 more popular RAMs in production, or that Apple produces the least number of laptops out of the more popular laptop companies out there.

This is because I did not know that we had to justify the importance of our question with evidence :( As such: (1) What is the question that you are going to answer? What is the correlation between laptop specifications and pricing information, and which specifications are most strongly associated with the price of laptops? (2) Why is this an important question? According to UNiDAYS, 97% of students said that their laptop was crucial to their course success. Before buying their laptop, the same survey showed that 89% of students do their research before purchasing. They also demonstrate price consciousness in their laptop purchases, with 92% using a discount code regularly, and one in three students being willing to wait for a discount to purchase the technology they want. As such, identifying which laptop specifications correlate with higher prices will allow students to plan their purchases out and better understand the tradeoffs they have to make financially should they desire specific components, and how much they can expect their desired laptop specs to cost typically, without being ripped off. (3) Which rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question? Laptop specifications such as ScreenResolution, Inches, Cpu, Ram, Memory, Gpu, OpSys, weight, as well as Price will be used to answer this question. I faced challenges in trying to come up with a data analysis question that was not too simplistic, and to come up with justifications for the question I wish to answer. I borrowed the help of some data science majors to help me articulate the questions I wished to ask using more precise and accurate vocabulary, and was able to find an adequately relevant data set to use."

How will it answer your larger question? Why are these the best visualizations to convey your story?)\nI will use scatter plots to visualize the relationship between each specification (CPU, RAM, GPU, etc) and laptop prices. This will identify any trends or patterns that may exist. I will then use boxplots to compare the distribution of laptop prices across different categories of specifications (such as diff types of CPUs, GPUs, etc). For simplicity’s sake, I will consider doing this for only the more common types of CPUs and GPUs. This will show how the different specifications will impact the prices of laptops. While scatter plots show the strength and direction of the relationship, box plots show the variation in price based on different specifications.\n(2) How do you plan to make it interactive? (What features of ggplot2/shiny/markdown do you plan to use to make the story interactive)\nI will use Shiny for interactive elements, including sliders, dropdown menus, etc. This will let users filter the data they want based on specific specifications (like by CPU brand or GPU brand) I will use ggplot2 to create the output of plots and graphs, based on the user’s input. The plot should update automatically to show the effect of the specification on laptop prices. E.g. if the user wishes to find out the different CPU’s effect on laptop prices, they can filter the CPU and price data to generate the relevant plots that can visualise this relationship.\n(3) What concepts incorporated in your project were taught in the course and which ones were self-learnt?

Leave the entry of the Week column empty for self-learnt concepts)\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\nInclude the challenges and errors that you faced and how you overcame them.\nI think it was challenging to find out which tools I can use. The course introduced a very overwhelming number of types of tools and packages for different purposes, and as a beginner to both data and code, I was confused as to which data plot to use that ought to demonstrate certain relationships, as well as how to code that out. While I am familiar with individual components of achieving the website or interactive feature, e.g. how to upload a dataset, how to allow users to filter it, and how to generate the dynamic plot (as in week 8), I think I struggled in articulating its function in the grand scheme of my ideas. I overcame this by looking through past material and collating a list of most attractive or useful features, then putting together a simple plan of what to do with these ideas."

As a completely new language and the first course I took regarding coding, it was a steep learning curve as someone who had little experience and aptitude for coding and data analysis. I struggled with imposter syndrome because I felt like I appeared to know what I was doing, but in reality I struggled with fully understanding what I was executing, despite the hand-held instructions through video-recorded lectures.\nHowever, I have learnt through this experience that coding is not so inaccessible to non-computer science students. Although I would not call myself an expert, I am proud that I can read R code semi-well, and am able to articulate my concepts through plots and diagrams. While I may not be required to code in the future from scratch such as in this project, perhaps reading R code and understanding how data can be represented will play a big role in my future career. Some data and computational literacy (aha! course name drop) is definitely useful in an era of technology and data.\nAs a CNM student, I aspire to break into communications or marketing roles in industries such as e-commerce! This skill set will be especially helpful if I have to make decisions off a data set. I am now confident in saying that in a scenario where I am assigned to unpack and decipher a raw csv file, I do have some basic skills in R that can accomplish such a task. For example, data such as tracking the popularity of an e-commerce product through clicks and purchases may come in the form of a csv file! I may be tasked to decipher the csv file in order to decide which product to emphasise marketing efforts for, or which product are successful and how to replicate such success. For example, there may be products that are popular enough for a recorded high number of click-ins, but comparatively little check-outs. These products can only be articulated through visualisation of a dataset, which will help me understand the next course of action in marketing it."
