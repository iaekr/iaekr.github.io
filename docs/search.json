    "text": "Ever got tired of your basic ASUS or HP laptop? Want to look into other options aside from Apple? Or are you simply curious about how many laptops can a company possibly produce?\nWelcome to my data story, where I take you through the analysis of a csv file, where we can both gain some insights about laptop brands, specifications, prices, and even its weight!\n\n\n\ntaken from vGeek\n\n\n\n\nWith the data set named “Laptop Prices Based on its specifications “ by user Abdul Rehman Amer from the website Kaggle, we can look at every computer that is manufactured this year.\nBelow is the summary of the data set at hand. There are a total of 12 columns, and we can look each laptop’s Company (or brand name), TypeName (Category of laptop), Inches (size of laptop), ScreenResolution (Screen Size), CPU, RAM, Memory, GPU, OpSys, Weight, and Price!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\nCompany\nTypeName\nInches\nScreenResolution\nCpu\nRam\nMemory\nGpu\nOpSys\nWeight\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n0\nApple\nUltrabook\n13.3\nIPS Panel Retina Display 2560x1600\nIntel Core i5 2.3GHz\n8GB\n128GB SSD\nIntel Iris Plus Graphics 640\nmacOS\n1.37kg\n71378.68\n\n\n1\nApple\nUltrabook\n13.3\n1440x900\nIntel Core i5 1.8GHz\n8GB\n128GB Flash Storage\nIntel HD Graphics 6000\nmacOS\n1.34kg\n47895.52\n\n\n2\nHP\nNotebook\n15.6\nFull HD 1920x1080\nIntel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz\n8GB\n256GB SSD\nIntel HD Graphics 620\nNo OS\n1.86kg\n30636.00\n\n\n3\nApple\nUltrabook\n15.4\nIPS Panel Retina Display 2880x1800\nIntel Core i7 2.7GHz\n16GB\n512GB SSD\nAMD Radeon Pro 455\nmacOS\n1.83kg\n135195.34\n\n\n4\nApple\nUltrabook\n13.3\nIPS Panel Retina Display 2560x1600\nIntel Core i5 3.1GHz\n8GB\n256GB SSD\nIntel Iris Plus Graphics 650\nmacOS\n1.37kg\n96095.81\n\n\n5\nAcer\nNotebook\n15.6\n1366x768\nAMD A9-Series 9420 3GHz\n4GB\n500GB HDD\nAMD Radeon R5\nWindows 10\n2.1kg\n21312.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will attempt to answer the question: How many types of laptops do each brand make, and which brands make the most expensive and most affordable types of laptops?\nAs everyday students who may not understand laptops intimately, when we intend on buying a new laptop, we look at the different types of laptop brands or companies that we heard from word of mouth, or by briefly searching for reviews online. As such, only the most prominent or famous brands stick out (such as Apple or Lenovo), and we never gain a truly representative overview of the types of laptops out there.\nAs this is typically a big expenditure for students, students should be well informed when making their decision, taking into account the brand reputation, specifications and brand of the laptop. In order to tackle the problem that the everyday student may not have a thorough overview of their options, I have decided to perform data visualisation with this data.\n\n#make this less wordy. Use graphs or visualisations to do this instead\n\n\n\n\nFrom the glimpse of the dataset here, we see that it includes many specifications such as CPU, Ram, Memory, GPU, the type of Operating System and even Weight, which I had originally intended to use in visualising their effects on the pricing of each computer. However, I realised that these are mostly categorical variables, which is difficult to convert into numerical variables that we can perform meaningful data analysis on.\nHence, I decided to focus on the company producing the laptops, arriving at the problem statement outlined above. In the dataset, there are a total of 19 companies that produce laptops. This can be seen in the data visualisation below.\n\n\nRows: 1,303\nColumns: 12\n$ X                &lt;int&gt; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,…\n$ Company          &lt;chr&gt; \"Apple\", \"Apple\", \"HP\", \"Apple\", \"Apple\", \"Acer\", \"Ap…\n$ TypeName         &lt;chr&gt; \"Ultrabook\", \"Ultrabook\", \"Notebook\", \"Ultrabook\", \"U…\n$ Inches           &lt;dbl&gt; 13.3, 13.3, 15.6, 15.4, 13.3, 15.6, 15.4, 13.3, 14.0,…\n$ ScreenResolution &lt;chr&gt; \"IPS Panel Retina Display 2560x1600\", \"1440x900\", \"Fu…\n$ Cpu              &lt;chr&gt; \"Intel Core i5 2.3GHz\", \"Intel Core i5 1.8GHz\", \"Inte…\n$ Ram              &lt;chr&gt; \"8GB\", \"8GB\", \"8GB\", \"16GB\", \"8GB\", \"4GB\", \"16GB\", \"8…\n$ Memory           &lt;chr&gt; \"128GB SSD\", \"128GB Flash Storage\", \"256GB SSD\", \"512…\n$ Gpu              &lt;chr&gt; \"Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640\", \"Intel HD Graphics 60…\n$ OpSys            &lt;chr&gt; \"macOS\", \"macOS\", \"No OS\", \"macOS\", \"macOS\", \"Windows…\n$ Weight           &lt;chr&gt; \"1.37kg\", \"1.34kg\", \"1.86kg\", \"1.83kg\", \"1.37kg\", \"2.…\n$ Price            &lt;dbl&gt; 71378.68, 47895.52, 30636.00, 135195.34, 96095.81, 21…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are some companies that produced very little laptops, and I felt they were not relevant to the total analysis, since the popularity of their products would likely be lower. The few laptop types they produced would also make it difficult to create any conclusive data trends about their products. Hence, I removed brands who produced less than 20 laptops from the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a horizontal table plot of the number of type of laptops that the 8 surviving companies produced. With the sufficient number of data, we can perform further analysis on the laptop types and their prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is the plot of the number of computers each company produces against the price of each unit of computers. Here, we can see which company tends to produce more affordable ranges of computers, and which company tends to produce more expensive range of computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#talk about the difference in the ascending order of box plots and the ascending order of number of laptops produced by each company\n\nWe observe some outliers in the data. In the above box plot, while the whiskers of each box vary, there are some data points that indiciate one or two abnormally expensive computers that lie beyond even the maximum value of the range of computers.\nFor example, Lenovo produces one laptop that costs more than $3,000, unusual as their line of laptops usually range from less than $500 to less than $1,000. ASUS also produces two computers that cost around $1,500, despite its range of products largely falling under $1,000. We can also see that Apple and MSI are the most consistent in their pricings, as there are no outliers in their box plots. They also happen to have the highest mean prices for their laptops, alongside Toshiba.\nBelow is the interactive boxplot that allows users to toggle between currencies of the prices, namely between IND (in which the original data came in), SGD and USD.\n \n\n\n\nAs a result, we can see from our graphs that comparatively, Lenovo, Dell and HP are brands that produce the most variety of laptops. Surprisingly, Apple, a popular consumer option for laptops, produce the least variety of laptops. We learn through this data that while purchasing from Apple may be a tempting option to go for, as they are known for their versatility in function, there is a chance that Lenovo, HP or Dell would have produced a laptop that met a student’s specific needs.\nBut why do we need to consider other laptop brands if Apple usually does the job? This is because Apple’s average price point, as seen in the second plot, is higher than the averages of the other companies. This indicates that there is a good chance that the laptop you are eyeing from Apple, while it may get the job done, may be excessively expensive. If one is tight on budget, it would be advisable for them to delve into Lenovo, HP or Dell for more varied options.\nMSI is a brand that has a higher mean price for their laptops than even Apple, making their laptops the most expensive out of all visible. However, this is likely because they produce gaming laptops, which tend to have higher specs for optimal gameplay, thus adding to the price point of their products.\n\n#make some sort of visualisation?"
