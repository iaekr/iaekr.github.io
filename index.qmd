# Identified data set

I have chosen the data set named "**Laptop Prices Based on its specifications "** by user Abdul Rehman Amer from the website Kaggle. I will attempt to answer the question: What is the correlation between laptop specifications and pricing information, and which specifications are most strongly associated with the price of laptops?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
my_data <- read.csv("laptop_data.csv")
glimpse(my_data)
```
