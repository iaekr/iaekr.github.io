# Identified data set

I have chosen the data set named "**History of Rock (1950-2020)"** by user Lucas Zamora from the website Kaggle. I will attempt to analyse the type **change over time** of the data set, looking at how different metrics such as danceability, acousticness and energy affect the popularity of rock songs, and how that metric may change over time.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
my_data <- read.csv("history-of-rock-spotify - Copy.csv")
glimpse(my_data)
```
