# Laptops...

Ever got tired of your basic ASUS or HP laptop? Want to look into other options aside from Apple? Or are you simply curious about how many laptops can a company possibly produce?

As budget-strapped students, buying our next laptop is a costly investment we should consider wisely. However, as someone who is not a tech expert and struggled in researching for a new laptop, I found it difficult to start my search because I was not well-versed with what laptops there were. I relied hugely on word of mouth and salesman recommendation to decide on my current laptop, but there may have been better options out there I was simply unaware of!

Thus, welcome to my data story, where I take you through the analysis of a csv file, where we can both gain some insights about laptop brands, specifications, prices, and even its weight! Through this journey, I hope we both gain an awareness of what types of laptops there are, and what categories to begin our search in the next time we find ourselves in need of a laptop. Personally, I'm interested in finding what the most common specs are (i.e. the most basic laptop models) -- that would mark a good place for me to start looking into laptops, and I could start looking for affordable options with the same specs, or for any specific or different specs I may need.

## Introducing: Our data

With the data set named "**Laptop Prices Based on its specifications "** by user Abdul Rehman Amer from the website Kaggle, we can look at every computer that is manufactured this year.

Below is the summary of the data set at hand. There are a total of 12 columns, and we can look each laptop's Company (or brand name), TypeName (Category of laptop), Inches (size of laptop), ScreenResolution (Screen Size), CPU, RAM, Memory, GPU, OpSys, Weight, and Price!

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
laptop_data <- read.csv("laptop_data.csv")
suppressMessages({
  suppressWarnings({
    library(tidyverse)
    library(fixerapi)
    library(ggplot2)
    library(dplyr)
    library(readr)
    library(ggtext)
    library(plotly)
    library(viridis)



options(scipen = 999)
knitr::kable(head(laptop_data))

  })
})

```

This is just a snippet of the entire data set. Let's break it down into simpler visualisations so we understand what it is talking about!

### Number of Laptop Types by Company

Here are the total number of laptops in the dataset, arranged by the brands that produce them!

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
total_brands_and_laptops <- laptop_data %>%
  group_by(Company) %>%
  tally()

# Define new colors for the companies
brand_colors <- c(
  "Asus" = "#eac435", "HP" = "#345995", "Apple" = "#03cea4", 
  "Dell" = "#fb4d3d", "Lenovo" = "#ca1551", 
  "Toshiba" = "#a0d1e3", "MSI" = "#e1a0d1", "Acer" = "#d1a0e3", 
  "Samsung" = "#f0c2ff", "Sony" = "#f7a6c2", "Huawei" = "#ffacac", 
  "Google" = "#ffc6ac", "Razer" = "#ffd9ac", "Microsoft" = "#ffe6ac", 
  "Xiaomi" = "#fff4ac", "Fujitsu" = "#e5ffac", "Mediacom" = "#acf2ff", 
  "LG" = "#acddff", "Chuwi" = "#acaaff"
)

# Use the new colors in your plots
ggplot(total_brands_and_laptops, aes(x = reorder(Company, n), y = n, fill = Company)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend=FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Company", y = "Number of Laptop Types", title = "Number of Laptop Types by Company") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)
```

Personally, I have never heard of brands such as Chuwi, Mediacom or Vero. Have you seen these laptops before?

![Source: Shopee](three%20unknown%20laptops.png)

It looks like Vero is an environmentally friendly laptop line from Acer! Let's merge the companies into one for clarity's sake, into a category called Acer&V.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
total_brands_and_laptops2 <- laptop_data %>%
  mutate(Company = ifelse(Company %in% c("Acer", "Vero"), "Acer&V", Company)) %>%
  group_by(Company) %>%
  tally()

# Define new colors for the companies
brand_colors <- c(
  "Asus" = "#eac435", "HP" = "#345995", "Apple" = "#03cea4", 
  "Dell" = "#fb4d3d", "Lenovo" = "#ca1551", 
  "Toshiba" = "#a0d1e3", "MSI" = "#e1a0d1", "Acer&V" = "#d1a0e3", 
  "Samsung" = "#f0c2ff", "Sony" = "#f7a6c2", "Huawei" = "#ffacac", 
  "Google" = "#ffc6ac", "Razer" = "#ffd9ac", "Microsoft" = "#ffe6ac", 
  "Xiaomi" = "#fff4ac", "Fujitsu" = "#e5ffac", "Mediacom" = "#acf2ff", 
  "LG" = "#acddff", "Chuwi" = "#acaaff"
)

# Use the new colors in your plots
ggplot(total_brands_and_laptops2, aes(x = reorder(Company, n), y = n, fill = Company)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend=FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Company", y = "Number of Laptop Types", title = "Number of Laptop Types by Company") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)
```
There are also many, many companies that produced very little laptops, and I doubt that I would want to buy from these brands. Thus, they're not releavnt to my analysis. I removed brands who produced less than 20 laptops from the data set.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
laptop_data2 <- laptop_data %>%
  mutate(Company = ifelse(Company %in% c("Acer", "Vero"), "Acer&V", Company)) 

brand_nos <- laptop_data2 %>% 
  group_by(Company) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  filter(n>10) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

# Define new colors for the companies
brand_colors <- c(
  "Asus" = "#eac435", "HP" = "#345995", "Apple" = "#03cea4", 
  "Dell" = "#fb4d3d", "Lenovo" = "#ca1551", 
  "Toshiba" = "#a0d1e3", "MSI" = "#e1a0d1", "Acer&V" = "#d1a0e3", 
  "Samsung" = "#f0c2ff", "Sony" = "#f7a6c2", "Huawei" = "#ffacac", 
  "Google" = "#ffc6ac", "Razer" = "#ffd9ac", "Microsoft" = "#ffe6ac", 
  "Xiaomi" = "#fff4ac", "Fujitsu" = "#e5ffac", "Mediacom" = "#acf2ff", 
  "LG" = "#acddff", "Chuwi" = "#acaaff"
)

#only 9 brands
ggplot(brand_nos, aes(x = reorder(Company, n), y = n, fill = Company)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Company", y = "Number of Laptops", title = "Number of Laptops Produced by Each Company") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)
```
Much better!

### Price against Brand

Below is the plot of the **number of computers** each **company** produces against the **price of each unit of computers**. Here, we can see which company tends to produce more affordable ranges of computers, and which company tends to produce more expensive range of computers.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
brand_quantity <- laptop_data %>% 
  select(Company, Weight, Price) %>% 
  group_by(Company) %>% 
  mutate(count = n()) %>% 
  filter(count>10) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(-count)

tosgd <- 0.016
tousd <- 0.012

brand_quantity <- brand_quantity %>% 
  mutate(Price = Price * tousd)

#ggplot(brand_quantity, aes(x = Price, y = Company)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(brand_quantity, aes(x = Price, y = reorder(Company, Price), fill = Company)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Price", y = "Company") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1)) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)
```

We observe some outliers in the data. In the above box plot, while the whiskers of each box vary, there are some data points that indiciate one or two abnormally expensive computers that lie beyond even the maximum value of the range of computers.

For example, Lenovo produces one laptop that costs more than \$3,000, unusual as their line of laptops usually range from less than \$500 to less than \$1,000. ASUS also produces two computers that cost around \$1,500, despite its range of products largely falling under \$1,000. We can also see that Apple and MSI are the most consistent in their pricings, as there are no outliers in their box plots. They also happen to have the highest mean prices for their laptops, alongside Toshiba.

Below is the interactive boxplot that allows users to toggle between currencies of the prices, namely between IND (in which the original data came in), SGD and USD.

```


### Number of Laptop Types by Category of Laptops

While we can look at the data through the lens of the company that produces them, we can also investigate the data through the Category of Laptops.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
typename_colour <- c(
  "2 in 1 Convertible" = "#E3B505", "Gaming" = "#95190C", "Netbook" = "#610345", "Notebook" = "#107E7D", "Ultrabook"="#044B7F", "Workstation"="#D72638"
)

ggplot(laptop_data, aes(x = TypeName, fill = TypeName)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Category", y = "Count", title = "Number of laptops against Category of Laptops") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = typename_colour)
```

Unsurprisingly, the Notebook category wins by a landslide in terms of quantity produced, with more than 650 types produced. On the other hand, Netbooks and Workstations are lesser produced, and perhaps this means there is a small demand for such laptops!

Curiously, there are only a little more than 100 2 in 1 Convertible laptops produced. I was once starstruck by the appeal of a 2 in 1, and almost invested in a HP one myself. However, there were one or two very bad reviews, and coupled with the low number of produced laptops of this type, perhaps I will wait until the technology for 2 in 1s are more advanced and reliable!

### Specifications

Now, I am also curious about the spread of specifications, such as CPU, RAM, Memory, GPU, OpSys. Since I am a student from CHS (FASS), and have no interest in gaming, specs such as GPU and even Operating Systems are not that important to me. Hence, let's look at how the laptops are distributed across different CPUs and RAMs, as I may consider these specs more heavily than others.

#### CPU
According to Arm, CPUs, or the Central Processing Unit, is the main component of a laptop that acts as its "brain", running the machine's operating systems and apps. It is key that we find a good CPU for a laptop that we may use for future years!

Given that there are a total of 118 unique CPUs, let's look at the more popular CPU systems; i.e. the CPUs that have been used in more than 40 laptops.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Filter out CPUs with counts less than 40
filtered_data <- laptop_data %>%
  group_by(Cpu) %>%
  filter(n() > 40)

# Create a new column in your dataset
filtered_data$cpu_category <- ifelse(filtered_data$Cpu %in% c("Intel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz", "Intel Core i7 7500U 2.7GHz", "Intel Core i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz"), "CPUs with <100 laptops", "Other CPUs")

# Plot using the new column
ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = Cpu, fill = cpu_category)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("CPUs with <100 laptops" = "#C492B1", "Other CPUs" = "#6D545D")) +
  labs(x = "CPU", y = "Count", title = "Number of Laptops by CPU Category (Count > 40)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
Based on the graph, I've highlighted the CPUs with more than a 100 produced laptops. These are the Intel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz, Intel Core i7 7500U 2.7GHz, and Intel Core i7 7700HQ 2.8GH.

### Price against CPU

For the CPUs that have been used in more than 40 laptops (i.e. the more popular CPUs), let's look at their price distribution.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
filtered_data_sgd <- filtered_data %>%
  mutate(Price = Price * tosgd)
# Create a new column "cpu_group" based on the CPU names
filtered_data_sgd <- filtered_data_sgd %>%
  mutate(cpu_group = case_when(
    Cpu %in% c("Intel Core i5 7200U 2.5GHz", "Intel Core i7 7500U 2.7GHz", "Intel Core i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz") ~ "Special CPUs",
    TRUE ~ "Other CPUs"
  ))

# Plot the boxplot with the new "cpu_group" column for fill
ggplot(filtered_data_sgd, aes(x = Cpu, y = Price, fill = cpu_group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "CPU", y = "Price", title = "Price vs. CPU Scatter Plot") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(500, 3000, by = 500), labels = function(x) ifelse(x %% 500 == 0, as.character(x), "")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#6D545D", "#C492B1"), labels = c("Other CPUs", "CPUs with >100 laptops"))

```
Looks like the CPU that has been produced the most, IntelCore i5 7200U 2.5GHz, remain relatively affordable in its distribution of price, with its mean approaching SGD$1,000. The other two popular CPUs, IntelCore i7 7500U 2.7GHz and IntelCore i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz, have a pricier distribution.

I do know that i7 CPUs perform better than the i5. If the price of my laptop is a bigger concern, I could start with considering the IntelCore i5 7200U 2.5GHz, but if I want a better functioning laptop, I could consider either of the identified i7s.

#### RAM
According to TechTarget, RAM, or random access memory, is the hardware that provides temporary storage for the operating system (OS), software programs or other data in current use in a laptop so they are quickly accessible to the device's processor. In layman terms, this means that a faster RAM will result in a laptop responding faster to your inputs!

No cleaning is needed for RAM as there are only 9 types of RAM these laptops come in -- let's look at how many laptops are produced in each RAM amount!

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Define the order of RAM categories
ram_order <- c("2GB", "4GB", "6GB", "8GB", "12GB", "16GB", "24GB", "32GB", "64GB")

# Convert RAM to a factor with the defined order
laptop_data$Ram <- factor(laptop_data$Ram, levels = ram_order)

# Create a bar plot for the "Ram" category with sorted values
ggplot(laptop_data, aes(x = Ram, fill = Ram)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#F9DC5C", "#E08E45", "#F9DC5C", "#E08E45", "#F9DC5C", "#E08E45", "#F9DC5C", "#F9DC5C", "#F9DC5C"))+
  labs(x = "RAM", y = "Count", title = "Number of Laptops by RAM Category (Sorted)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

Looks like the most popular RAM categories are 4GB, 8GB and 16GB, highlighted in a darker yellow! How interesting that their in-between values like 6GB, 12GB etc. are nowhere near as popular.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Define the order of RAM categories
ram_order <- c("2GB", "4GB", "6GB", "8GB", "12GB", "16GB", "24GB", "32GB", "64GB")

# Convert RAM to a factor with the defined order
laptop_data$Ram <- factor(laptop_data$Ram, levels = ram_order)


# Create a bar plot for the "Ram" category with sorted values
ggplot(laptop_data, aes(x = Ram, y = Price * tosgd, fill = Ram)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "RAM", y = "Price", title = "Price vs. RAM Box Plot") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#F9DC5C", "#E08E45", "#F9DC5C", "#E08E45", "#F9DC5C", "#E08E45", "#F9DC5C", "#F9DC5C", "#F9DC5C")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```
This seems intuitive enough -- the higher the RAM, the more expensive the laptop gets. However, according to the boxplot, it may be possible to get a 16GB RAM laptop that costs the same as another 8GB RAM laptop. We should thus consider this price range when scouting for our high-RAM laptops!

## CPU against RAM
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(filtered_data_sgd, aes(x = Cpu, y = Ram, color = Price)) +
  geom_point(size=5) +
  scale_colour_viridis()+
  labs(x = "CPU", y = "RAM", color = "Price") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```


## Price against Weight
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
filtered_data_sgd <- filtered_data %>%
  mutate(Price = Price * tosgd)

# Scatter plot of price against weight
# Assuming 'Weight' is a character or factor variable
# Remove "kg" and convert to numeric
filtered_data_sgd$Weight_numeric <- as.numeric(sub("kg", "", as.character(filtered_data_sgd$Weight)))

# Now you can use 'Weight_numeric' in your ggplot
ggplot(filtered_data_sgd, aes(x = Weight_numeric, y = Price)) +
  geom_point(color = "#5B8C5A") +
  labs(x = "Weight (kg)", y = "Price", title = "Price vs. Weight Scatter Plot") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

filtered_data_sgd$Weight_numeric <- as.numeric(sub("kg", "", as.character(filtered_data_sgd$Weight)))


# Create a scatter plot
plot_ly(data = filtered_data_sgd, x = ~Inches, y = ~Weight_numeric, z = ~Price*tosgd,
        type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers", color = ~Price*tosgd,
        marker = list(size = 5, opacity = 0.8)) %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = "Inches"),
                      yaxis = list(title = "Weight"),
                      zaxis = list(title = "Price (SGD)")))
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Scatter plot of price against inches
ggplot(filtered_data_sgd, aes(x = Inches, y = Price)) +
  geom_point(color = "#C04ABC") +
  labs(x = "Inches", y = "Price", title = "Price vs. Inches Scatter Plot") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## old shit

From the glimpse of the dataset here, we see that it includes many specifications such as CPU, Ram, Memory, GPU, the type of Operating System and even Weight, which I had originally intended to use in visualising their effects on the pricing of each computer. However, I realised that these are mostly categorical variables, which is difficult to convert into numerical variables that we can perform meaningful data analysis on.

Hence, I decided to focus on the company producing the laptops, arriving at the problem statement outlined above. In the dataset, there are a total of 19 companies that produce laptops. This can be seen in the data visualisation below.

However, there are some companies that produced very little laptops, and I felt they were not relevant to the total analysis, since the popularity of their products would likely be lower. The few laptop types they produced would also make it difficult to create any conclusive data trends about their products. Hence, I removed brands who produced less than 20 laptops from the dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
brand_nos <- laptop_data %>% 
  group_by(Company) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  filter(n>10) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

# Define new colors for the companies
brand_colors <- c(
  "Asus" = "#eac435", "HP" = "#345995", "Apple" = "#03cea4", 
  "Dell" = "#fb4d3d", "Lenovo" = "#ca1551", 
  "Toshiba" = "#a0d1e3", "MSI" = "#e1a0d1", "Acer" = "#d1a0e3", 
  "Samsung" = "#f0c2ff", "Sony" = "#f7a6c2", "Huawei" = "#ffacac", 
  "Google" = "#ffc6ac", "Razer" = "#ffd9ac", "Microsoft" = "#ffe6ac", 
  "Xiaomi" = "#fff4ac", "Fujitsu" = "#e5ffac", "Mediacom" = "#acf2ff", 
  "LG" = "#acddff", "Chuwi" = "#acaaff"
)

#only 9 brands
ggplot(brand_nos, aes(x = reorder(Company, n), y = n, fill = Company)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Company", y = "Number of Laptops", title = "Number of Laptops Produced by Each Company") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = brand_colors)
```



## Scatter plot: price against weight, or inches

Below is a horizontal table plot of the number of type of laptops that the 8 surviving companies produced. With the sufficient number of data, we can perform further analysis on the laptop types and their prices.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

#Printing horizontal bar graph
ggplot(brand_nos, aes(x = n, y = Company)) +
  labs(x="Number of types of laptops", y="Company")+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

## Reach a Conclusion

As a result, we can see from our graphs that comparatively, Lenovo, Dell and HP are brands that produce the most variety of laptops. Surprisingly, Apple, a popular consumer option for laptops, produce the least variety of laptops. We learn through this data that while purchasing from Apple may be a tempting option to go for, as they are known for their versatility in function, there is a chance that Lenovo, HP or Dell would have produced a laptop that met a student's specific needs.

But why do we need to consider other laptop brands if Apple usually does the job? This is because Apple's average price point, as seen in the second plot, is higher than the averages of the other companies. This indicates that there is a good chance that the laptop you are eyeing from Apple, while it may get the job done, may be excessively expensive. If one is tight on budget, it would be advisable for them to delve into Lenovo, HP or Dell for more varied options.

MSI is a brand that has a higher mean price for their laptops than even Apple, making their laptops the most expensive out of all visible. However, this is likely because they produce gaming laptops, which tend to have higher specs for optimal gameplay, thus adding to the price point of their products.
