# I. Document

Instead of on the topic of rock music as previously indicated in last week's diary entry, I have decided to change my database to "Laptop Prices Based on its specifications", uploaded onto kaggle by user Abdul Rehman Amer. This is because I did not know that we had to justify the importance of our question with evidence :( As such:

## **(1)** What is the question that you are going to answer?

What is the correlation between laptop specifications and pricing information, and which specifications are most strongly associated with the price of laptops?

## **(2)** Why is this an important question?

According to UNiDAYS, 97% of students said that their laptop was crucial to their course success. Before buying their laptop, the same survey showed that 89% of students do their research before purchasing. They also demonstrate price consciousness in their laptop purchases, with 92% using a discount code regularly, and one in three students being willing to wait for a discount to purchase the technology they want. As such, identifying which laptop specifications correlate with higher prices will allow students to plan their purchases out and better understand the tradeoffs they have to make financially should they desire specific components, and how much they can expect their desired laptop specs to cost typically, without being ripped off.

## (3) Which rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question?

Laptop specifications such as ScreenResolution, Inches, Cpu, Ram, Memory, Gpu, OpSys, weight, as well as Price will be used to answer this question.

I faced challenges in trying to come up with a data analysis question that was not too simplistic, and to come up with justifications for the question I wish to answer. I borrowed the help of some data science majors to help me articulate the questions I wished to ask using more precise and accurate vocabulary, and was able to find an adequately relevant data set to use.
