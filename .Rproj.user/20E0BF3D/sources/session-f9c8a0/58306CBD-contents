# Diary entry Document 1

**What is the topic you have finalized? (Answer in 1 or 2 sentences)**

I have decided on the topic of rock music, and want to analyse how over time, the popularity of different rock music may be defined by different metrics such as danceability or acousticness. This may reflect the trends of the music scene and how different styles are regarded as popular during different periods of time.

This would fall under the type: change over time.

What it does: Uses a chronology to illustrate a trend.

Discussions it starts: Why did this happen, or why does it keep happening? What can we do prevent or make this happen?

**What are the data sources that you have curated so far? (Answer 1 or 2 sentences).**

I have curated the data source called **"History of Rock (1950-2020)"** by user Lucas Zamora from the website Kaggle.
