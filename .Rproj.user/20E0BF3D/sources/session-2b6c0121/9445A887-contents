## Diary Entry 4 (14/04/2024)

**Write a short report on the following:**

**Reflect on your experience doing the project using R\
What have you learned in NM2207, and how can that be helpful in your future career?\
Try to identify use-cases within your specialization and future industry that you might benefit by using R.**

This project was undeniably difficult. As a completely new language and the first course I took regarding coding, it was a steep learning curve as someone who had little experience and aptitude for coding and data analysis. I struggled with imposter syndrome because I felt like I appeared to know what I was doing, but in reality I struggled with fully understanding what I was executing, despite the hand-held instructions through video-recorded lectures.

However, I have learnt through this experience that coding is not so inaccessible to non-computer science students. Although I would not call myself an expert, I am proud that I can read R code semi-well, and am able to articulate my concepts through plots and diagrams. While I may not be required to code in the future from scratch such as in this project, perhaps reading R code and understanding how data can be represented will play a big role in my future career. Some data and computational literacy (aha! course name drop) is definitely useful in an era of technology and data.

As a CNM student, I aspire to break into communications or marketing roles in industries such as e-commerce! This skill set will be especially helpful if I have to make decisions off a data set. I am now confident in saying that in a scenario where I am assigned to unpack and decipher a raw csv file, I do have some basic skills in R that can accomplish such a task. For example, data such as tracking the popularity of an e-commerce product through clicks and purchases may come in the form of a csv file! I may be tasked to decipher the csv file in order to decide which product to emphasise marketing efforts for, or which product are successful and how to replicate such success. For example, there may be products that are popular enough for a recorded high number of click-ins, but comparatively little check-outs. These products can only be articulated through visualisation of a dataset, which will help me understand the next course of action in marketing it.
